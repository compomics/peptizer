1. INTRODUCTION
---------------------
Peptizer is a versatile platform that dynamically employs pluggable criteria to filter peptide identifications.

In proteomics, peptides are often identified from mass spectrometry data by a database search algorithm such as Matrix Science MASCOT. Each identification is assigned a score that reflects the confidence with which it has been identified. False positives still occur however, and should be rooted out for optimal specificity. By allowing expert criteria for the detection of false positives to be rapidly and easily implemented, Peptizer can greatly enhance filtering such suspicious peptide identifications.
Peptide identifications that match the chosen filtering criteria can then be further assessed in the efficient manual validation environment of Peptizer.

      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

4.   CHANGELOG
---------------------

 - Version 1.0
        * Initial release.

 - Version 1.0.1
        * Updates the dependency of MascotDatfile to verion 1.3.4.
	* Added the SingleProteinHit agent that selects peptidehits with a single proteinhit for filtering purposes.

 - Version 1.1
        * Adds an option to enable or disable the ObjectOutputStreams of confident and non-confident peptide identifications that were not selected by Peptizer.

 - Version 1.2
        * Finetuning of the graphical user interface upon reviewer feedback. Buttons were moved, menus were reorganized and new dialogs were created.
        * The second major change of the usage of MascotDatfile version 2.0. Besides the in-memory parsing of Mascot result files, now there is another
        method of index-based parsing. This allows Peptizer to work with Mascot result files up to hundreds of megabytes.
        As a testscenario, Peptizer processed a 700MB Mascot result file consuming 400MB of memory.

 - Version 1.2.1
        * This release updates the ms_lims functionality.
        * First the Ms_lims project iterator was updated as it can now handle paralel searches for the same MS/MS spectra.
        * Second an iterator was added on demand to get PeptideIdentifications by their identification identifier
        from the ms_lims database.
        * Also, a nullpointer was resolved when persisting validation into ms_lims.

  - Version 1.2.2
         * A new command line class to run Peptizer on the ms_lims database.
         * First the Ms_lims project iterator was updated as it can now handle paralel searches for the same MS/MS spectra.
         * A MetaKey enum was introduced for referencing various objects such as the 'Masses'.

  - Version 1.2.3
         * Added an option to add Agents by class reference of from the agent_complete.xml file.
         * Added the DeltaMassError Agent (ppm and Da).

  - Version 1.2.4
         * Added the Modification Coverage Agent. This Agent looks up a modification and reports for fragmentions around the modification side for direct evidence of the site.
         *
